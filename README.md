## üìñ Project Overview

The real estate market is complex and dynamic. This project aims to simplify price prediction for properties in Bangalore by leveraging machine learning. Using a dataset of Bangalore housing listings, we perform extensive data preprocessing to handle missing values and outliers, engineer new features to improve accuracy, and train a regression model. The final model is wrapped in a Flask API and presented through a user-friendly web interface where users can input property details and receive an estimated price.

-----

## üîë Key Features

  - **Data Cleaning:** Robust techniques to handle missing data, inconsistent formatting, and duplicates.
  - **Outlier Detection & Removal:** Statistical methods to identify and remove price-distorting outliers.
  - **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new features like `price_per_sqft` to enhance model performance.
  - **Regression Modeling:** Implementation and evaluation of multiple regression algorithms to find the best fit.
  - **Interactive Web UI:** A clean and simple web interface built with Flask for easy interaction with the model.
  - **End-to-End Deployment:** The entire application is containerized and deployed on a cloud platform (Render).

-----

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

  - **Backend:** Python, Flask
  - **ML/Data Science:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
  - **Deployment:** Render, Gunicorn
  - **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

-----

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The project follows a standard machine learning application workflow:

```
1. Data Collection       (Bengaluru House Data.csv)
      |
      v
2. Data Preprocessing    (Jupyter Notebook: data cleaning, feature engineering)
      |
      v
3. Model Training        (Jupyter Notebook: training Linear Regression, Lasso, etc.)
      |
      v
4. Model Serialization   (Exporting the trained model to a .pickle file)
      |
      v
5. API & UI Development  (Flask server `app.py`, HTML/CSS frontend)
      |
      v
6. Deployment          (Deploying the Flask app on Render)
```

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Application**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

3.  **Access the App**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

-----

## üí° Usage

Once the application is running, you can predict a house price by:

1.  Selecting a location from the dropdown menu.
2.  Entering the total square feet of the property.
3.  Choosing the number of Bathrooms and Bedrooms (BHK).
4.  Clicking the **"Predict Price"** button to see the estimated price in lakhs.

-----

## üìä Model Performance

Several regression models were tested, with **Lasso Regression** providing the best results after hyperparameter tuning.

  - **Evaluation Metric:** R¬≤ Score (Coefficient of Determination)
  - **Test Set R¬≤ Score:** `~0.82`

This score indicates that the model can explain approximately 82% of the variance in house prices, making it a reliable predictor.

## üìö Project Learnings

  - **The Power of Preprocessing:** The quality of input data directly dictates model performance. A significant portion of this project was dedicated to cleaning and structuring the dataset, which was a critical learning experience.
  - **Feature Engineering is Key:** Simple features like location and size are important, but engineered features like `price_per_sqft` were instrumental in removing outliers and improving model accuracy.
  - **Deployment Challenges:** Transitioning from a local Jupyter Notebook to a deployed web application involves its own set of challenges, including dependency management, environment configuration, and ensuring application stability.
